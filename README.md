I'm not sure that if you will see this or not, as you know I dont have enough time to do this. (I knew this intern plan in the last few hours.)
And finally I'm done with 2 questions.
Anyway, I try to do my best, hopefully your team members would see this directory. 

2 problem,
1. visitors problem is in visitor.js
2. todo app, first you need to type 'npm build', and then you need to access index.html under current directory.
Thanks =)
