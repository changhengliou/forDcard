I'm not sure that if you will see this or not, as you know I dont have enough time to do this. (I knew this intern plan in the last few hours.)<br/>
And finally I'm done with 2 questions.<br/>
Anyway, I try to do my best, hopefully your team members would see this directory. <br/>
<br/>
2 problem,<br/>
1. <b>visitors problem</b> is in visitor.js<br/>
2. <b>todo app</b>, first you need to type 'npm build', and then you need to access index.html under current directory.<br/>
Thanks =)
